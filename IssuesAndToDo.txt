Needed Things
- Graphics for Save/Load buttons (switch to image click)
- Graphics for Big/Small buttons (switch to image click)
- Add Heart/Magic container counters
- Add Attack/Magic/Heart levels

General Issues
- group color is yellow instead of blue if all collectible items are already collected
- update all ellipses within group when un/marking group parent as collected
